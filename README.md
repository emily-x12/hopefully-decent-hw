# hopefully-decent-hw

* In this assignment the goal was to fix the links that were not fuctioning, consolidate the ccs, and make sure the html semantics were structured.

* I made sure to condense all duplicate classes into one, and make sure I change things up on the HTML document, so that the changes matched up.

* I changed certain classes to HTML element tags where it seemed like it might make things look less messy.

* The CSS is way less messy.
